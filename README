     This script provide a command, :TeXtags, that will generate a tags
file in the current directory based on a LaTeX .aux file.  If you are editing
the file foo.tex in the current directory, just type :TeXtags.  You can then
use Vim's tag functions to display, or jump to, labels in foo.tex.

     At the moment, this only works for \label{} commands, not bibliographic
citations.  TODO:  handle \bibcite; handle multiple files with \input lines;
be more intelligent about directories; escape problematic characters in tags;
use :silent and <buffer> for Vim 6.0; etc.
